# FacialRecognitionSystem
# Abstract
Advancement in airport security systems have vastly improved in time, however recent attacks in airports demand further enchantments in technological advancements to detect high-profile users using machine learning technology, identifying such users with efficiency and ease, current facial technology is not sufficient to identify individuals within modern times. This thesis aims to design and implement a software bridging machine learning algorithm current facial imaging classifier to produce a live feed with the capabilities to detect specific high-profile users if such user is found then the authorities are alerted. The proposed system will be tested via an external webcam using a facial image dataset.
Keywords: machine learning, facial recognitio
